We have a string of length N. The string contains only lower-case letters (a-z)

Can you figure out the number of occurrences of the most frequent substring in
this string?

We are only interested in the substrings that follow the following properties:
	The length of a substring lies between K & L.
	The number of unique characters in the substring do not exceed M.

Constraints:
2 <= N <= 100000
2 <= K <= L <= 26, L < N
2 <= M <= 26

Input
The first line contains an integer N. The second line contains three space
separated integers, K L M. The third line contains the string of length N.

Sample Input #00
5
2 4 26
abcde

Sample Output #00
1

Explanation #00
All substring of length 2, 3 or 4 in abcde have only 1 occurrence. And
number of character in substring is clearly less than 26 hence answer
is 1.

Sample Input #01
6
2 3 4
ababab

Sample Output #01
3

Explanation #01
Size 2 we have 'ab' : count is 3, 'ba' count is 2
Size 3 we have 'aba' : count is 2, 'bab' count is 2
Clearly most often substring is 'ab' and hence Answer is 3

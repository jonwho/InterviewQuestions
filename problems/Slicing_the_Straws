You have N straws, where the length of each straw is a positive integer. You
are repeatedly performing slice operations on the straws until you have no
straws left.

In a slice operation, the length of every straw is reduced by the length of
the shortest straw.

For example, suppose we have 6 straws of the following length:
5 4 4 2 2 8

On the first slice operation, we cut length 2 from each straw and remove
the now-empty straws.

We repeatedly perform slice operations until there are no straws left.
Given N straws and their lengths, print the number of straws that you cut
at each slice operation.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer N.
The next line contains N integers: a(0), a(1), ..., a(n - 1) separated by space,
where a(i) represents the length of i-th straw.

Output Format
For each slice operation, print the number of straws that are cut in
separate line.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= a(i) <= 1000
